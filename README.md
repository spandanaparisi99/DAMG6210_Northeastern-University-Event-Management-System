# DAMG6210_Northeastern-University-Event-Management-System
### DAMG6210 course project. 

The Northeastern Event Management Database's goal is to compile all the university's events, workshops, and seminars in one location. 

The numerous undergraduate clubs, graduate clubs, centers, and organizations at Northeastern University frequently plan and host a wide range of events every week of the year. Most of the event publicity comes from word of mouth, banners placed around campus, Instagram, and Facebook. Some activities, such as career workshops, are only available through the Career Center's website. 

It can be difficult to stay on top of the activities or seminars going on around the campus because everything has a specific website or app to go to. By offering a single database with a comprehensive listing of all Northeastern on-ground and online activities, we hope to be a one-stop solution for the events happening on campus. 

The events in the database, together with their timings, locations, and other relevant information, can be quickly scanned by students to help them decide where to go next in their free time.
